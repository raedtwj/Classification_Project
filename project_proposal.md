# Project Proposal Template

## Background:

* Company info:\
we are a Dates Fruit company called Tamrifier (Tamr + classifier) for Date fruit classification using image processing.
<!-- we are an advertising company caller AdSpam our goal is to make websites visitors live harder by maximizing there chance to click on an Ad (clickbait) -->
* Problem or opportunity:\
automate the proocess of classifing Date fruits to minimize costs and time.


## Data Description:
images obtained from [Date fruit datasets](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/date-fruit-dataset-automated-harvesting-and-visual-yield-estimation) and will be processed to extract this data\
**the project might be changed if we did not get the expected data from image processing**
<!-- data could be extracted from images -->

| Type              | Date fruit Type                                                |
| Width             | Date fruit width                                               |
| Height            | Date fruit Height                                              |
| Color             | Date fruit Color (might be more than one)                      |
| Color Percentage  | Date fruit Percentage for each color                           |
| Area              | Date fruit Area                                                |


* the number of images is 8000 but its not cleand or processed yet
* there is 152 clean images.

## Tools:
* Technologies: Python, Jupyter notebook
